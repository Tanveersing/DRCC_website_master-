I am committed to creating a student-centred learning environment where each student is recognized as an individual with unique talents, goals, and perspectives. I strive to engage students actively in the learning process by encouraging open dialogue, discussions, and debates. I value the diversity of thoughts and experiences students bring to the classroom and leverage this diversity to enrich the learning experience for all. By creating an inclusive and supportive atmosphere, I aim to foster a sense of ownership and accountability among students, empowering them to take an active role in their own education.
